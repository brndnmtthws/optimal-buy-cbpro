Scheduled buying of BTC, ETH, and LTC from GDAX optimally! Be your own index/hedge fund, and stop paying those greasy management fees.

# What is this?

This is a Python script you can use to automatically buy Bitcoin, Ethereum,
Litecoin, and more using the GDAX API. By default, it buys these 3 currencies,
weighted by market cap (as reported by
[coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/)), using a form of [dollar cost
averaging](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) according to
the following logic (assuming default values):

1. Check current balances of fiat (USD by default), BTC, ETH, and LTC
1. If the fiat balance is above $25, buy BTC, ETH, and LTC weighted by market
   cap, as follows:
    * If there's enough fiat available, place 5 discounted limit orders at the
    current price minus 0.5% up to 4.5%, each order with 1/5th of the remaining
    amount to buy for each coin (see
    "[Details on the orders placed](#details-on-the-orders-placed)", below)
    * If there isn't enough USD available, place 1 buy order at 0.5% off the
    current price (see
    "[Order Minimums](https://support.gdax.com/customer/portal/articles/2725970-trading-rules)")
1. If the fiat account balance is below $25 (or whatever you specify), withdraw
coins to desired addresses

In effect, this script mimmicks the behaviour of a market cap weighted index
fund, but without the fees. It also only supports the coins that trade on GDAX
(because that's the only exchange that has an API for ACH deposits AFAIK).

You can also use the same script to schedule deposits from your bank account
periodically, such as when you're paid. The parameters may be configured to suit
your preferences, such as which coins to buy, external balances, discount
values, number of steps, etc.

Orders, deposits, and withdrawals are tracked in a SQLite DB, and the withdrawn
balances are added to the balances on GDAX to make sure the weights are
maintained over time. The SQLite DB can be swapped out for any DB that
SQLAlchemy supports.

A note on the default parameters: it's likely you'll want to change
`--starting-discount`, `--discount-step`, or `--order-count`. The more spread
out the orders are (i.e., difference between the current price and the lowest
priced order), the longer they will take to fill (if they fill), and the closer
the orders are, the more likely you are to miss out on bigger price drops. You
should consider your appetite for risk and how much you want to optimize for
catching those dips vs. not missing out on gains. There is no magic here. My
personal advice is to stick somewhat close to the defaults, and try to
continuously deposit a little more fiat every week to spread the risk but also
catch some dips.

Ideally, this script would help to make sure that when we dipâ€”

**we buy**.

# Will you help me set this up?

Feel free to create a GitHub issue if you need help, and I will help you if it
doesn't require too much effort on my part. I generally do not provide
consulting services for free. If you want to hire me, find my contact details
through the Internet and contact me using whatever your preferred contact method
is.

# USE AT OWN RISK

Duh. Not my fault if you lose everything.

Unless you place **absolute trust** in me, some guy from the Internet, I suggest
you clone the repo and build your own container to protect yourself from any
type of funny business.

# How do I use it?

1. Get yourself a hardware wallet, such as a
[Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [TREZOR](https://trezor.io/).
1. Set up a GDAX account, and link your bank account
1. Create a GDAX API key with view, trade, manage, transfer, and bypass-2fa
permissions
1. Determine the payment_method_id value by using the
[GDAX API](https://docs.gdax.com/#payment-methods) (you can use your browser's
developer toolbar,
[here's a quick video showing how](https://youtu.be/NmSEBGbn7Mc))
1. Get a machine somewhere (GCE, EC2, Digital Ocean) with Docker and systemd
1. Copy systemd files over:

        $ sudo cp systemd/optimal-buy-gdax-*.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system
1. Edit [`/etc/systemd/system/optimal-buy-gdax-buy.service`](optimal-buy-gdax-buy.service),
[`/etc/systemd/system/optimal-buy-gdax-buy.timer`](optimal-buy-gdax-buy.timer),
[`/etc/systemd/system/optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.service`](optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.service), and
[`/etc/systemd/system/optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.timer`](optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.timer) to your liking. Make sure you:

    * Change the BTC, ETH, and LTC withdrawal addresses to deposit the coins
    into your wallet (use a Ledger or TREZOR)
    * Pop in the correct API keys
    * Check the deposit amount (start with something small, like $150, to make
    sure it actually works first)
    * Check the timer dates (it would be sensible to change the hh:mm so your
    script doesn't run the same time as everyone else's), make sure the deposit
    timer fires according to your deposit schedule (keeping in mind that ACH
    takes 2-5 business days to clear, typically)
    * Consider specifying your external balances in order to accurately
    calculate the weights and amounts to purchase

1. Enable the systemd units:

        $ sudo systemctl enable optimal-buy-gdax-buy.service
        $ sudo systemctl enable optimal-buy-gdax-buy.timer
        $ sudo systemctl enable optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.service
        $ sudo systemctl enable optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.timer

1. Start the systemd timers:
        $ sudo systemctl start optimal-buy-gdax-buy.timer
        $ sudo systemctl start optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.timer

1. Enjoy!

    }

# Details on the orders placed

By default, there are 5 orders placed (for each currency) in steps of 1%,
starting at a 0.5% discount from the current price. To illustrate, if the
current price was $100 (per LTC, let's say), and you had $100 to buy, the orders
would look like this:

Order | Size      | Price
------|-----------|------
1 | 0.2010 LTC | $99.5
2 | 0.2030 LTC | $98.5
3 | 0.2051 LTC | $97.5
4 | 0.2072 LTC | $96.5
5 | 0.2094 LTC | $95.5

Furthermore, the amount of each currency to buy will be based on the current
market cap weighting of each coin. For example, at the time of writing the
weights are:

Coin | Market Cap (USD) | Weight
-----|------------------|-------
BTC | $195,824,365,435 | 0.791
ETH | $46,080,472,372 | 0.186
LTC | $5,592,776,540 | 0.023

So if your USD account had $1000 to invest, the amount invested in each would
become:

Coin | Weight | Amount Invested
-----|--------|----------------
BTC | 0.791 | $791
ETH | 0.186 | $186
LTC | 0.023 | $23

# Caveats/limitations

* If you try to trade manually or using some other bot at the same time,
you're probably going to have a bad time
* You might have a few dollars (<$25, you can change this with
`--withdrawal-amount`) sitting in your account at all times,
even when all orders have been filled because it's not always possible to
fill all orders and there may be small rounding errors (on the order of cents)
* It makes a best effort with minimal complexity to invest all of your fiat,
but it may not be possible to fill all orders right away
* It may take a few days for the market to drop enough for the buys to fill
* If the market experiences a significant bull run, your orders won't be
filled, but it will reset every 24h (using the default buy timer)
